## The 5th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools (OSACT)

Fine-grained detection of hate speech on Arabic Twitter Shared Task:

Detecting offensive language and hate speech has gained an increasing interest from
researchers in NLP and computational social sciences communities in the past few years. For
example, at the ACL 2021 main conference, there wereare 3 papers about offensive language,
and 10 papers about hate speech (https://2021.aclweb.org/program/accept/). Additionally,
there was a dedicated workshop on online abuse and harm with a shared task on hateful memes
(https://www.workshopononlineabuse.com/home#h.czplpodomjyq). Detecting offensive
language and hate speech is very important for online safety, content moderation, etc. Studies
show that the presence of hate speech may be connected to hate crimes (Hate Speech Watch,
2014).

Given the success of the shared task on Arabic offensive language detection at OSACT 2020
(https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/workshops/OSACT4/), we decided to continue our effort to
enhance detection of offensive language and hate speech on Arabic Twitter. We share with the
research community the largest annotated Arabic tweets that donâ€™t have bias towards specific
topics, genres or dialects. Each tweet is judged by 3 annotators using crowdsourcing for
offensiveness. Offensive tweets were classified to one of hate speech types: Gender, Race,
Ideology, Social Class, Religion, and Disability. Also, annotators judged whether a tweet has
vulgar language or violence.

Hate speech is defined as any kind of offensive language (insults, slurs, threats, encouraging
violence, etc.) that targets a person or a group of people based on common characteristics such
as race, gender, religion and belief, etc.

### The corpus contains ~13K tweets in total: 35% are offensive and 11% are hate speech. Vulgar
### and violence tweets represent 1.5% and 0.7% of the whole corpus.
Ratios of offensive language and hate speech in the corpus are the highest among other corpora
without using pre-specified keywords or selecting a specific domain.
